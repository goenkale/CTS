== Objectives

The purpose of this tutorial is to understand what can be simulated in a process definition using Camunda Platform 8 and why should we include it in our tests.

== Introduction

=== What is a token?

The execution of a process definition is also known as a process instance. A token represents a virtual instance of a process definition.

=== Why use tokens to simulate?

Running process instances usually require some input data, human intervention, connexion to external information systems and so on. *Tokens will go free through the process flow with no requirements*. This is useful to validate our process instance expectations.


WARNING: _Token simulation is not based on time or on frequency. It won't return any time or frequency metrics._

=== How does it work?

==== Enable the Token Simulation

- Toggle the Token Simulation to enable the feature.

==== Start a Token Simulation

- Click image:icons/play.png[play, width=5%] in the Start event of your process definition.

==== Check the Token Simulation log

- Click image:icons/log.png[log, width=5%] in the action buttons at the top left corner.

==== Switch the Token Simulation speed

- Click image:icons/speed.png[speed, width=15%] in the action buttons at the bottom.

== Use Case scenario



== Test your knowledge

Select the right answers for the following statements:

. Camunda Token Simulation feature let me
  .. switch the token speed
  .. identify the bottlenecks 
  .. know how many time my process instance will take
  .. create multiple tokens at once
  .. 
  .. display the token simulation log
  .. start/stop tokens
  ..
