== Objectives

The purpose of this tutorial is to understand what can be simulated in a process definition using Camunda Platform 8 and why should we include it in our tests.

== Introduction

=== What is a token?

The execution of a process definition is also known as a process instance. A token represents a virtual instance of a process definition.

=== Why use tokens to simulate?

Running process instances usually require some input data, human intervention, connexion to external information systems and so on. *Tokens will go free through the process flow with no requirements*. This is useful to validate our process instance expectations.

CAUTION: _Token simulation is not based on time or on frequency. It won't return any time or frequency metrics._

=== How does it work?

==== Enable the Token Simulation

- Toggle the Token Simulation to enable the feature.

image::processes/toggle.gif[title="Enable the Token Simulation"]

==== Start a Token Simulation

- Click image:icons/play.png[play, width=5%] in the Start event of your process definition.

==== Check the Token Simulation log

- Click image:icons/log.png[log, width=5%] in the action buttons at the top left corner.

==== Switch the Token Simulation speed

- Click image:icons/speed.png[speed, width=15%] in the action buttons at the bottom.

== Use Case scenario: Ticketing

Let's demonstrate the Token Simulation using a use case scenario.

=== Import the Ticketing BPMN diagram to your project

- Download this process definition link:/ticketing.bpmn[]

- Connect to your https://modeler.cloud.camunda.io/[Camunda Platform 8 - Modeler]

- Create a new project called "*Token Simulation Test*"

- Click **New** button > **Upload files**

image::icons/upload.png[title="Upload the shared file ticketing.bpmn"]

- Browse to your **_ticketing.bpmn_** file

- Click "*Open*" button

image::icons/ticketing.bpmn.png[title="Uploaded BPMN diagram ticketing.bpmn"]

- Click the *ticketing.bpmn* BPMN diagram

- Deploy your diagram using the button image:icons/deploy.png[Deploy ticketing.bpmn, width=30%]

- Select your cluster and click *Deploy*

=== Test the Ticketing BPMN diagram

This BPMN diagram describes a Ticketing process definition from a Customer Support team. 

image:icons/XORGateway.png[] Exclusive gateways help us to take process flows based on conditions. They are useful to merge process flows.


image:icons/ANDGateway.png[] Parallele gateways take all the outgoing flows. They also wait for all input flows to arrive before continuing the process.

==== Scenario 1 - STEPS

The _**Customer**_ will:

- *Provide ticket information* in a human task.

The _**General Support**_ team will:

-  *Qualify* the ticket with a first resolution as "**Additional information needed**". 
- Wait for the customer to "**Provide Additional Information**".
- *Qualify* again the ticket with a second resolution as "**resolved**".

The _**Customer**_ will:

- *Notify resolution* in a manual task.

===== Scenario 1 - TEST

Enable the Token Simulation and start a new token. Try to follow this Scenario 1 switching the gateways in real time using this button image:icons/switchGateway.png[]

===== Scenario 1 - TEST RESULT

image::tokenSimulations/scenario1-failed.gif[title="Ticketing BPMN diagram - Token Simulation: Scenario 1 failed"]
The token is blocked at the Parallele gateway, which is waiting for all the incoming flows to arrive before continuing. But only one arrives.

===== HOW TO FIX IT

- Disable the Token Simulation
- Switch the Paralelle gateway to an Exclusive gateway

image::icons/switchToExclusive.png[title="Switch a Gateway type"]

- Enable the Token Simulation.
- Start a new token to run the scenario 1 again.

==== Scenario 2 - STEPS

The _**Customer**_ will:

- *Provide ticket information* in a human task.

The _**General Support**_ team will:

-  *Qualify* the ticket with a resolution as "**Analysis needed**". 

The _**Advanced Support**_ team will:
- *Analyze* the ticket with a resolution as "**Schedule onsite visit**"

The _**Technical Support**_ team will:
- *Schedule onsite visit* to a tecnician available.
- *Resolve* the ticket by a tecnician.

The _**Customer**_ will:

- *Notify resolution* in a manual task.

===== Scenario 2 - TEST

Enable the Token Simulation and start a new token. Try to follow this Scenario 2 switching the gateways in real time using this button image:icons/switchGateway.png[]

===== Scenario 2 - TEST RESULT

image::tokenSimulations/scenario2-failed.gif[title="Ticketing BPMN diagram - Token Simulation: Scenario 2 failed"]

The token is duplicated after the *Analyze* human task at the Parallele gateway, which is triggering all the outgoing flows. 

Then, the *Notify Resolution* manual task is executed twice, as a consequence.

===== HOW TO FIX IT

- Disable the Token Simulation
- Switch the Paralelle gateway to an Exclusive gateway
- Enable the Token Simulation.
- Start a new token to run the Scenario 2 again.

=== Conclusion

In this Ticketing example we detected two bottlenecks of different natures: one of them was [.underline]#bloking# the process flow (Scenario1) and the other was [.underline]#duplicating# a task (Scenario2).
Token Simulation feature could help us validating our process flows. 


== Validate your knowledge

Select the right answers for the following statements:

. The Token Simulation feature let me
  .. switch the token speed
  .. display the token simulation log
  .. start/stop tokens
  .. do all the previous actions

. Token Simulation is useful to
  .. know how many time my process instances will take (in average)
  .. define a number of tokens to evaluate the most common path taken
  .. identify process bottlenecks 
  .. run my process backwards
